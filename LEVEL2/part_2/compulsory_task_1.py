Compulsory Task 1: 
------------------

Copy the code provided below to a new file named compulsory_task_1.py: 
1. Add another method in the Course class that prints the head office location: Cape Town
2. Create a subclass of the Course class named OOPCourse
3. Create a constructor that initialises the following attributes and assigns these values:
    --- "description" with a value "OOP Fundamentals"
    --- "trainer" with a value "Mr Anon A. Mouse"
4. Create a method in the subclass named "trainer_details" that prints what the 
   course is about and the name of the trainer by using the description and trainer attributes.
5. Create a method in the subclass named "show_course_id" that prints the ID number of the course: #12345
6. Create an object of the subclass called course_1 and call the following methods
   contact_details
   trainer_details
   show_course_id
   These methods should all print out the correct information to the terminal

Note: this task covers single inheritance. Multiple inheritance is also possible in Python and 
we encourage you to do some research on multiple inheritance when you have finished this course.
