1.1 

With agile changes can be made and implemented differently and in a cost effective
manner. Agile emthod relies heavily on user feedback. The waterfall method is much more 
rigid. It requires one step to be complete before moving onto to another. This means
making changes to the software takes more time and requires more resources

 Manifesto number 1: individuals and interactionsover process and tools

 Its easy for team members to get used to each other and forget the reason why they are there
 which is to develop tools and software that helps businesses and users meet their needs. If a team
 is too familiar they could focus too much on interaction, socialising and team building and less 
 on the work that actually needs to get done. The processes and tools is the reason why they were hired and 
 its important to remind the individuals that results matter too 

 1.3 
 Agile method is a methodology that priorities rapid development and change. At its core is user feedback 
 and continous version control which allows a software solution to get better with time 


 1.4 
 Because the needs of users and business evolve and need to adpat to the changing business climate. In the last 50 years
 weve gone from paper record keeping to everything being virtual and in the clouds. If a the business doesnt adpat and therefore
 also change the systems it uses it could find itself losing market share. Requiremnts change because they allow businesses to stay 
 competitive.  

 1.5
 Allows the developer to understand the problem in its fullness. They then get a better understanding of what the solution should be and 
 not what they think. It gives them a goal to work towards instead of working on code without an intended direction. Theyll also know how the feature
 is meant to address the problem that the requirement seeks to solve
